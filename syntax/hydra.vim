" How to color a digit at the beginning of a line followed by a tilde:
"     syn match  hydra_digit          '^\d\+\ze\~'
"     hi link  hydra_digit          DiffAdd

" The commented code here fails  to conceal the tilde. Probably, because there's
" an overlap between the 2 syntax items (even though we use `\zs` and `\ze`).
